// This is a console-based calculator using C code.
// The program will expand but currently only includes two operations. 
// The user can choose to add or subtract and only use two numbers at a time. 
// There is also a feature that sees when an unavailable operation is chosen, and resets the program. 
#include<stdio.h>

#define OPERATION "Enter the calculator operation you want to do:" //Asks the user to enter an operation

// Function called 
void addition(); //Calls the addition function
void subtraction(); //Calls the subtraction fucntion
void calculator_operations(); //Calls the calculator operations function

/*Main Program*/
